🚀 My First Machine Learning Project | First Step Toward Real-World ML Implementation

I recently completed my first end-to-end Machine Learning project, focused on understanding how ML models actually work in practice — not just in theory.

This project marks my first step toward practical ML implementation, where I explored how data, models, and evaluation come together in a real workflow.

🔹 Problem Statement

📌 Predict calorie burn using physiological data and analyze how different regression models perform on the same dataset.

🔹 Dataset & Preprocessing

🧩 Worked with a real-world health dataset
🧹 Cleaned and prepared raw data
📊 Performed feature understanding and selection
🔁 Split data for training and evaluation

🔹 Models Implemented (Comparative Approach)

🔹 Linear Regression
→ Used as a baseline to understand linear relationships and model behavior

🔹 XGBoost Regressor
→ Used to explore how ensemble learning improves prediction accuracy and captures complex patterns

🔹 Why This Project?

🎯 To understand the difference between simple and advanced models
📈 To analyze performance instead of just training models
🧠 To build strong ML fundamentals before moving to advanced topics

🔹 Key Learnings

✔ Data preprocessing & feature understanding
✔ Model training and evaluation workflow
✔ Comparing baseline vs ensemble models
✔ Understanding model behavior, not just results
✔ How real ML projects differ from classroom examples

This being my first ML project, my focus was on learning the process deeply, writing clean code, and building a strong foundation for future projects.
