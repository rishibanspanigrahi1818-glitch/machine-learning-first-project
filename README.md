🚀 My First Step into Machine Learning — Learning by Building

I recently completed my first hands-on Machine Learning project, where I explored how raw data turns into meaningful predictions using Python.

This project helped me understand the end-to-end ML workflow, from data handling to model evaluation — not just theory, but real implementation.

🔍 What I worked on:

• Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas
• Exploratory data analysis to understand patterns
• Training regression models using scikit-learn
• Evaluating results and understanding model behavior 

🧠 What I learned:

• How important clean data is before modeling
• How different features impact predictions
• Why model evaluation matters more than accuracy alone
• How ML works in practice, not just in textbooks

🛠 Tools & Technologies:

Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | scikit-learn

This project is a beginner-level learning project, but it gave me clarity and confidence to move forward in Machine Learning.
I’m still learning and improving — feedback or suggestions are always welcome!
